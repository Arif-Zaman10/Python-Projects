Password Generator

This project is a simple password generator built using Python. It creates a random password based on the number of letters, symbols, and numbers chosen by the user. The program uses lists to store randomly selected characters, then shuffles them to make the password more secure and unpredictable. Finally, it combines all characters into a single string and displays the generated password.

Through this project, I practiced using loops, lists, the random module, and string manipulation. I also learned how to use random.choice() to select random elements and random.shuffle() to rearrange items in a list. This project helped me better understand how to build logic step by step and generate dynamic output in Python.
